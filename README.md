# grpc-web poc

This repo is an Angular web frontend that communicates with a grpc golang service on the backend. Its a very small and simple POC so don't expect miracles.

This POC is based on [gRPC-Web](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web)

## Getting Started

Its not rocket science. You're going to have to figure it out ;)
